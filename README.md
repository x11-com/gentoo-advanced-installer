## About Gentoo-install
The GUI Installer guides you through the configuration process with detailed information regarding each step. The configurations are stored in the `gentoo.conf` file which can also be edited by hand by renaming the 'gentoo.conf.example' file, backed up and reused later if desired. 

## Partitioning
Supported disk layouts include ext4, ZFS and as well as additional layers such as LUKS or MDRAID.

## Boot Options
It also supports both EFI (recommended) and BIOS boot and can be used with Systemd or OpenRC as the init system.

![](contrib/screenshot_configure.png)

## Quickstart

1. Boot into a live environment such as [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/download/) live iso.
2. Clone/download this repository.
3. Run `./configure` to launch the GUI Installer
4. Finally run `./install` to begin the installation process

## Important Information

1. The system will use `sys-kernel/gentoo-kernel-bin` should be replaced with a custom-built one when the system is functional.
2. Adjust `/etc/portage/make.conf`
   - Set `CFLAGS` to `-O2 -pipe -march=native` for native builds
   - Set `CPU_FLAGS_X86` using the `cpuid2cpuflags` tool
   - Set `FEATURES="buildpkg"` if you want to build binary packages
3. Use a safe umask like `umask 0077`
4. If you are looking for a way to detect and manage your kernel configuration, have a look at [autokernel](https://github.com/oddlama/autokernel).

### Optional

1. Ssh You can provide keys that will be written to root's `.ssh/authorized_keys`

## Introduction

Gentoo is a Linux distribution that, unlike binary distros like Arch, Debian and many others, the software is compiled locally according to the user preferences and optimizations.

The name of Gentoo comes from the penguin species who are the fastest swimming penguin in the world.

I've been using Gentoo since 2002, and what I like most from Gentoo is:

* Is fun
* The possibility to get everything under control
* Deep customization
* One learn **a lot** from using it

| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Please keep in mind that this is not a generic guide on how to install Gentoo. This guide focuses on a few precise install options. |

This guide is made for those of you who wants to:

1. Install Gentoo Linux
2. Learn from an amazing Linux distro and its installation process
3. Want to use systemD and not OpenRC

If you are that kind of person, speak *emerge* and enter :wink:

## Installation concerns

> Stop before further reading. It's important to know that this guide only contemplates an installation with uefi, crypt/luks disk, lvm partitioning and systemd init system. Please remember that if you want a different setup don't take this as a how-to but more as a general guideline. Also remember to keep an eye on each step to adapt it to your taste :thumbsup:

## Start live-cd environment

The first thing we need to install our Gentoo is a live-cd environment with uefi vars enabled.

I personally like [systemrescuecd](http://www.system-rescue-cd.org) because ~~is a Gentoo based distro~~ (now is Arch based, but still makes the job) and has uefi vars enabled. You can download it here [bootable usb](https://www.system-rescue-cd.org/Sysresccd-manual-en_How_to_install_SystemRescueCd_on_an_USB-stick). But it doesn't mather what distro you use as far as it's UEFI compatible.

To make sure that the distro is UEFI compatible we can run:

```shell
efivar -l
```

If the command listed the UEFI variables we're ready to go!

### Prepare Hard disk

There some available options to do that job, I prefer to use gdisk, but others like cgdisk or parted should do the job.

```shell
gdisk /dev/sda
```

Create new GUID partition table and destroy everything on disk:

```shell
o (Create a new empty GUID partition table (GPT))
Proceed? Y
```

Then create the following two partitions like below code. I'm not making a swap because I have enough ram but feel free to make one if you really want it (inside crypt partition).

```shell
n (Add a new partition)
Partition number 1
First sector 2048 (default)
Last sector +512M
Hex code EF00

n (Add a new partition)
Partition number 2
First sector 1050624 (default)
Last sector (press Enter to use remaining disk)
Hex code 8e00
```

If everything looks good, save and quit:

```shell
w
Y
```

Partitions should look something like this:

```shell
gdisk -l /dev/sda
Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
   1            2048         1050623   512.0 MiB   EF00  EFI
   2         1050624       500118158   238.0 GiB   8300  LVM
```

### Prepare crypt container

Let's set up the encryption container where the lvm volume will be. Just before start creating it it's much important to check which is the best performance setup on your system because you can't change it once created, run:

```shell
cryptsetup benchmark
```

In my laptop the best performance setup is aes-xts:

```shell
# Tests are approximate using memory only (no storage IO).
PBKDF2-sha1       306601 iterations per second for 256-bit key
PBKDF2-sha256     352818 iterations per second for 256-bit key
PBKDF2-sha512      94568 iterations per second for 256-bit key
PBKDF2-ripemd160  227951 iterations per second for 256-bit key
PBKDF2-whirlpool  121362 iterations per second for 256-bit key
#  Algorithm | Key |  Encryption |  Decryption
     aes-cbc   128b   604.2 MiB/s  2515.2 MiB/s
 serpent-cbc   128b    83.8 MiB/s   517.0 MiB/s
 twofish-cbc   128b   180.3 MiB/s   333.7 MiB/s
     aes-cbc   256b   449.5 MiB/s  1934.8 MiB/s
 serpent-cbc   256b    85.8 MiB/s   516.9 MiB/s
 twofish-cbc   256b   183.2 MiB/s   332.8 MiB/s
     aes-xts   256b  2110.6 MiB/s  2052.8 MiB/s
 serpent-xts   256b   518.3 MiB/s   502.5 MiB/s
 twofish-xts   256b   323.0 MiB/s   328.5 MiB/s
     aes-xts   512b  1677.8 MiB/s  1601.8 MiB/s
 serpent-xts   512b   518.9 MiB/s   502.4 MiB/s
 twofish-xts   512b   322.6 MiB/s   327.4 MiB/s
```

Once we know that proceed with the creation itself:

```shell
cryptsetup -v --cipher aes-xts-plain64 --key-size 256 -y luksFormat /dev/sda2
```

Then open up our new crypt container to be able to create the lvm inside. In this procedure the label *cryptcontainer* is only a trivial name, so you can use whenever you like:

```shell
cryptsetup open --type luks /dev/sda2 cryptcontainer
```

### Create lvm volumes

In that point we've our luks container and using lvm minimize the partitioning design time, because you can modify whenever you need. In my setup I use one partition for *root* filesystem and other for *home* files, feel free to add as much as you need/like:

```shell
pvcreate /dev/mapper/cryptcontainer
vgcreate vg0 /dev/mapper/cryptcontainer
lvcreate --size 50G vg0 --name root
lvcreate -l +100%FREE vg0 --name home
```

### Create filesystems

Let's create the filesystems for our three partitions (two of them inside crypt lvm setup :v:):

```shell
mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sda1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/vg0-root
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/vg0-home
```

### Mount the new system

It's time to mount our partitions:

```shell
mkdir /mnt/gentoo
mount /dev/mapper/vg0-root /mnt/gentoo
mkdir -p /mnt/gentoo/boot
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/gentoo/boot
mkdir /mnt/gentoo/home
mount /dev/mapper/vg0-home /mnt/gentoo/home
```

## Installing the Gentoo base system

Before installing Gentoo, make sure that the date and time are set correctly. A mis-configured clock may lead to strange results in the future! To check our current system date just run:

```shell
date
```

If needed set correct date like (March 02 22:09 2016):

```shell
date 030222092016
```

### Install the stage3 tarball

In order to avoid starting from a Linux from scratch, the Gentoo developers provide us with a Stage 3 which is a base binary semi-working non-bootable environment suitable to save us such an amount of time. To do that we just only need to download it and uncompress in our filesystem tree:

```shell
cd /mnt/gentoo
wget http://mirror.eu.oneandone.net/linux/distributions/gentoo/gentoo/releases/amd64/autobuilds/current-stage3-amd64/stage3-amd64-systemd-20210405T120143Z.tar.xz
```

Unpacking the stage tarball into our local disk:

```shell
tar xvf stage3-*.tar.xz --xattrs
```

### Configuring compile options

As I said, Gentoo is a great Linux distro because its deep customization and portage is its cornerstone.

Portage is the Gentoo autobuild system, similar to packing systems like apt, yum or pacman in binary distros. It's inspired by FreeBSD port system. Pre-compiled binaries are also available, but these are out of reach of this guide.

Wikipedia says:
> Portage is Gentoo's software distribution and package management system. The original design was based on the ports system used by the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) based operating systems. The portage tree contains over 10,000 packages ready for installation in a Gentoo system.

Portage describe how to build the packages based on CPU architecture Flags and which features are available for every package with what are known as "use flags".

Let's see how to setting up portage with our system CPU flags.
Run:

```shell
gcc -c -Q -march=native --help=target | grep march
```

GCC will tell you which architecture have in your system to be set in the portage optimizations flags:

```shell
nano -w /mnt/gentoo/etc/portage/make.conf
```

These are mine safest available flags:

```shell
CFLAGS="-march=broadwell -O2 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer"
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
```

And MAKEOPTS describe how many allowed parallel jobs are available to use by building system. Usually I use the same that my CPU has, but somebody says that *number_of_cpu + 1* is the best option. I don't care
We can see how many cores we have running:

```shell
grep processor /proc/cpuinfo
processor       : 0
processor       : 1
processor       : 2
processor       : 3
```

Then I set it inside make.conf like:

```shell
MAKEOPTS="-j4"
```

If you want to know exactly which is the best option here you can read this post to choose your best option [MAKEOPTS=”-j${core} +1″ is NOT the best optimization](https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2013/01/14/makeopts-jcore-1-is-not-the-best-optimization/).

### Selecting mirrors

Set the best mirrors for your location. Be sure that you have Internet access from your live-cd:

```shell
mirrorselect -i -o >> /mnt/gentoo/etc/portage/make.conf
```

### Configuring the main Gentoo repository

Copy the official repository file and select which you want to use:

```shell
mkdir /mnt/gentoo/etc/portage/repos.conf
cp /mnt/gentoo/usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf /mnt/gentoo/etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf
nano -w /mnt/gentoo/etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf
```

### Copy DNS info

Copy the dns information from your working live-cd environment:

```shell
cp -L /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/gentoo/etc/
```

### Mounting the necessary filesystems

In addition to lvm filesystem we created in our local disk, there's other pseudo-filesystems which are created during system boot that are needed to chroot into our new environment:

```shell
mount -t proc proc /mnt/gentoo/proc
mount --rbind /sys /mnt/gentoo/sys
mount --make-rslave /mnt/gentoo/sys
mount --rbind /dev /mnt/gentoo/dev
mount --make-rslave /mnt/gentoo/dev
```

### Entering the new environment

Chroot into the new environment:

```shell
chroot /mnt/gentoo /bin/bash
source /etc/profile
export PS1="(chroot) $PS1"
```

Great! We are now inside our final Gentoo system but we need to bake it a little more time.

### Configuring Portage

Portage consists of two main parts, the ebuild system and emerge. The ebuild system takes care of the actual work of building and installing packages, while emerge provides an interface to ebuild: managing an ebuild repository, resolving dependencies and similar issues.

First we need to synchronize the remote repositories with the local Portage tree to knows what packages are available to be installed.

### Installing a Portage snapshot

Download an snapshot from the remote repositories we defined inside make.conf:

```shell
emerge-webrsync
```

### Updating the Portage tree

Then update the snapshot with the latest version of the repos:

```shell
emerge --sync
```

### Choosing the right profile

A Portage profile specifies default values for global and per-package USE flags, specifies default values for most variables found in /etc/portage/make.conf, and defines a set of system packages. The profiles are maintained by the Gentoo developers as part of the Portage tree (/usr/portage/profiles).

List the available profiles:

```shell
eselect profile list
```

From the output list we must select our best fitting option. Once our system is based on systemd, the best profile we can choose is the *systemd*. Of course we can choose others like Gnome which needs systemd to run, but we want a minimal environment to be configured.

```shell
[..]
[12]  default/linux/amd64/13.0/systemd
[..]
```

Choose the profile with eselect utility:

```shell
eselect profile set 12
```

### Configuring the USE variable

As we said [USE flags](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/USE_flag) are a core feature of Gentoo, and a good understanding of how to deal with them is needed for administering a Gentoo system.

The USE variable allows the system wide setting or deactivation of USE flags in a space separated list while are set inside [/etc/portage/make.conf](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/make.conf#USE) or for better fine grained per package control we should set them inside [/etc/portage/package.use](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/package.use).

If we use tools like *ufed* we can easelly set system wide Flags since I prefer to choose it manually to set per package defined Flags and use as minimum as possible as system-wide. So, if you choose the easy/system-wide way simply install ufed with:

```shell
emerge ufed
```

And then run it to select the USE Flag with a beautiful user interface :smile:

```shell
ufed
```

If you, like me, want to get everything under control, then you would love an utility named *quse* from *portage-utils* package. This utility tell us which package use any specified flag.
For example, if you want to know which packages use the *dbus* flag we simply need to run:

```shell
quse dbus
```

And all packages will be shown to us.

Ok, nothing better than test it by ourself!

```shell
emerge -a app-portage/portage-utils
```

These are the system wide USE Flags described in my make.conf file:

```shell
nano -w /etc/portage/make.conf
```

```shell
USE="X aac alsa aspell bash-completion boost branding caps contrib \
     cpudetection cryptsetup dbus exif filecaps flac gd gpm gstreamer gzip \
     hardened hddtemp highlight hostname imagemagick int64 introspection \
     jemalloc jpeg jpeg2k json kdbus kmod kms libav libnotify lm_sensors lz4 \
     lzma lzo mime mp3 mp4 mpeg nano-syntax networkmanager nss numa ogg \
     opencl opengl pango pcap pdf pie png pulseaudio python recode samba sdl \
     seccomp simplexml slang smp sockets sound spell sse sse2 ssh \
     startup-notification svg systemd tcmalloc theora threads \
     timezone truetype udisks upnp upnp-av upower usb video vim vim-syntax \
     vorbis wavpack wayland wayland-compositor wifi xcomposite xfs xft \
     xinerama xkb xml xmlrpc xorg xpm xrandr xwayland xz zeroconf \
     zsh-completion -cups"
```

The rest of the flags are per package defined inside */etc/portage/package.use/* and here you can choose to set everything inside a file or not, simply arrange them as you like. I created these files (you can get it from this same repository):

```shell
ls /etc/portage/package.use/
```

```shell
admin devel emulation fonts fs games media network office perl system terms themes utils xorg
```

USE flags are not the only optimizations we want from our portage system. Other flags corresponding to the instruction sets and other features specific to the x86 (amd64) architecture are configured into the variable called CPU_FLAGS_X86.

We can simply use a useful python script to auto-detect which of them we should set. Install *app-portage/cpuinfo2cpuflags*:

```shell
emerge -a app-portage/cpuid2cpuflags
```

And then run it to get those values:

```shell
cpuid2cpuflags-x86
```

```shell
CPU_FLAGS_X86="aes avx avx2 fma3 mmx mmxext pni popcnt sse sse2 sse3 sse4_1 sse4_2 ssse3
```

Put the output line into */etc/portage/make.conf*

```shell
cpuinfo2cpuflags-x86 >> /etc/portage/make.conf
```

If you would like (and believe me you should) get deeper knowledge of portage system, don't hesitate to read the official documentation [wiki.gentoo.org](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage).

## Configuring base system

In addition to Portage there's some other options should be configured before the end of the bake :grin:

### Timezone

Configuring the time zone of our system's clock:

```shell
echo "Europe/Madrid" > /etc/timezone
```

Next, reconfigure the *sys-libs/timezone-data* package, which will update the /etc/localtime file based on the /etc/timezone entry. The /etc/localtime file is used by the system C library to know the timezone the system is in:

```shell
emerge --config sys-libs/timezone-data
```

### Configure locales

Locales are a set of information that most programs use for determining country and language specific settings. To set the system locales we need to set it inside:

```shell
nano -w /etc/locale.gen
```

And then execute locale-gen to generate all the locales specified in the /etc/locale.gen file and write them to the locale-archive (/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive).

```shell
locale-gen
```

Once done, it is now time to set the system-wide locale settings. Again we use eselect for this, now with the locale module.

```shell
eselect locale list
Available targets for the LANG variable:
  [1]   C
  [2]   en_US.utf8
  [3]   POSIX
  [ ]   (free form)
```

Choose which locales would you like to active and then do it manually editing */etc/env.d/02locale* or automatically by:

```shell
eselect locale set 2
```

Now reload the environment:

```shell
env-update && source /etc/profile && export PS1="(chroot) $PS1"
```

### Installing Systemd

Before continue we must remove udev and openrc otherwise we've cyclic dependencies in the future:

```shell
emerge --deselect sys-fs/udev
emerge --unmerge sys-fs/udev
```

Also be sure that we don't have nothing related with openrc or systemd as masked package:

```shell
emerge --deselect sys-apps/openrc
emerge --unmerge sys-apps/openrc
rm /etc/portage/package.mask/systemd
```

Once we have our system prepared it's time to ensure that we have systemd installed with all required USE flags:

```shell
emerge -a app-portage/gentoolkit
euse -E cryptsetup systemd gudev dbus
emerge -a sys-apps/systemd
emerge -a sys-apps/dbus
```

### Configuring Linux kernel

While Portage is the core of Gentoo Linux system the Linux kernel is the core of the operating system and offers an interface for programs to access the hardware. The kernel contains most of the device drivers.

To create a kernel, it is necessary to install the kernel source code first. The Gentoo recommended kernel sources for a desktop system are, of course, sys-kernel/gentoo-sources. These are maintained by the Gentoo developers, and patched to fix security vulnerabilities, functional problems, as well as to improve compatibility with rare system architectures. But as always in Gentoo there's other options also available.

To get a full list of kernel sources with short descriptions can be found by searching with emerge:

```shell
emerge --search sources
```

#### Installing the sources

Let's install the gentoo-sources:

```shell
emerge -a sys-kernel/gentoo-sources
```

Now it is time to configure and compile the kernel sources. There are two approaches to do that job:

1. The kernel is manually built and install.
2. A tool called genkernel is used to automatically build and install the Linux kernel.

In both cases we must configure it manually that normally is the most difficult procedure a Linux user ever has to perform. Nothing is less true - after configuring a couple of kernels no-one even remembers that it was difficult :wink:

So I'll explain how to use genkernel which help us to maintain config files and some more automations :smiley:

However, one thing is true: it is vital to know the system when a kernel is configured manually. Start by install required packages:

```shell
emerge -a sys-apps/pciutils sys-kernel/genkernel
```

Edit */etc/genkernel.conf* to set our preferences:

```shell
nano -w /etc/genkernel.conf
```

```shell
INSTALL="yes"
OLDCONFIG="yes"
MENUCONFIG="yes"
NCONFIG="no"
CLEAN="yes"
MRPROPER="yes"
MOUNTBOOT="yes"
SYMLINK="no"
SAVE_CONFIG="yes"
USECOLOR="yes"
CLEAR_CACHE_DIR="yes"
POSTCLEAR="1"
MAKEOPTS="-j5"
LVM="yes"
LUKS="yes"
DMRAID="no"
UDEV="yes"
BOOTDIR="/boot"
GK_SHARE="${GK_SHARE:-/usr/share/genkernel}"
CACHE_DIR="/var/cache/genkernel"
DISTDIR="/var/lib/genkernel/src"
LOGFILE="/var/log/genkernel.log"
LOGLEVEL=1
DEFAULT_KERNEL_SOURCE="/usr/src/linux"
COMPRESS_INITRD="yes"
COMPRESS_INITRD_TYPE="best"
```

Notice that LVM, LUKS and UDEV must be set on to have this system works otherwise will not boot.

Once configured then simply run:

```shell
genkernel all
```

#### Configuring the modules

If we need to auto-load a kernel module each time to system boots we should specify it in */etc/conf.d/modules* file.

You can list your available modules with:

```shell
find /lib/modules/<kernel version>/ -type f -iname '*.o' -or -iname '*.ko' | less
```

#### Installing firmware

Some drivers require additional firmware to be installed on the system before they work. This is often the case for network interfaces, especially wireless network interfaces. Most of the firmware is packaged in *sys-kernel/linux-firmware*, so installing them are almost needed in a laptop system:

```shell
emerge -a sys-kernel/linux-firmware
```

### LVM Configuration

Install lvm tools if it's not yet installed:

```shell
emerge -a sys-fs/lvm2
```

Then edit the package configurations:

```shell
nano -w /etc/lvm/lvm.conf
```

```shell
use_lvmetad = 1
issue_discards = 1
volume_list = ["vg0"] # Our VG volume name, check with vgdisplay
```

### Fstab

Before editing fstab we need to know which UUID are using our devices inside and outside lvm and luks volumes:

```shell
blkid /dev/mapper/vg0-root | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/"//g'
UUID="576e229c-cf68-4010-8d85-ff8149158416"
blkid /dev/mapper/vg0-home | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/"//g'
UUID="95fa5807-ea57-4cf5-b717-74f4aba190e2"
```

Then edit fstab:

```shell
nano -w /etc/fstab
```

```shell
/dev/sda1                                       /boot   vfat    noatime                                         1 2
UUID="576e229c-cf68-4010-8d85-ff8149158416"     /       ext4    discard,noatime,commit=600,errors=remount-ro    0 1
UUID="95fa5807-ea57-4cf5-b717-74f4aba190e2"     /home   ext4    discard,noatime,commit=600                      0 0
tmpfs                                           /var/tmp tmpfs  nodev,nosuid    								0 0
tmpfs                                           /tmp    tmpfs   nodev,nosuid    								0 0

### Configuring crypttab

Warning!!! As we don't have encrypted partitions other than root which must be mounted by systemd before the whole system start we don't need to set it up there, so, our crypttab must be empty.

### Configuring mtab

In the past some utilities wrote information (like mount options) into /etc/mtab and thus it was supposed to be a regular file. Nowadays all software is supposed to avoid this problem. Still, before switching the file to become a symbolic link to /proc/self/mounts.

To create the symlink, run:

```shell
ln -sf /proc/self/mounts /etc/mtab
```

### Systemd boot (bootloader)

Systemd-boot is a simple UEFI boot manager which executes configured EFI images. The default entry is selected by an on-screen menu.

It is simple to configure, but can only start EFI executables, such as the Linux kernel EFISTUB, UEFI Shell, GRUB, and go on.

Before installing the EFI binaries we need to check if EFI variables are accessible:

```shell
emerge -a sys-libs/efivar
efivar -l
```

Verify that you have mounted /boot:

```shell
mount | grep boot
```

Once got it mounted then install the systemd-boot binaries:

```shell
bootctl --path=/boot install
```

This command will copy the systemd-boot binary to your EFI System Partition ($esp/EFI/systemd/systemd-bootx64.efi and $esp/EFI/Boot/BOOTX64.EFI - both of which are identical - on x64 systems) and add systemd-boot itself as the default EFI application (default boot entry) loaded by the EFI Boot Manager.

Every time there's a new version of the systemd you should copy the new binaries to that System Partition by running:

```shell
bootctl --path=/boot update
```

### Add bootloader entries

Add one entry into bootloader with this options:

```shell
nano -w /boot/loader/entries/gentoo.conf
```

```shell
title    Gentoo Linux
efi      /kernel-genkernel-x86_64-4.4.6-gentoo
options  initrd=/initramfs-genkernel-x86_64-4.4.6-gentoo crypt_root=/dev/sda2 root=/dev/mapper/vg0-root root_trim=yes init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd ro dolvm
```

Edit default loader:

```shell
nano -w /boot/loader/loader.conf
```

```shell
default gentoo
timeout 3
```

### Efibootmgr

Efibootmgr is not a bootloader itself it's a tool that interacts with the EFI firmware of the system, which itself is acting as a boot loader. With the efibootmgr application, boot entries can be created, reshuffled and updated.

First we need to install the package:

```shell
emerge -a sys-boot/efibootmgr
```

To list the current boot entries:

```shell
efibootmgr -v
```

```shell
BootCurrent: 0003
Timeout: 1 seconds
BootOrder: 0003
Boot0000* Linux Boot Manager	HD(1,GPT,3eb8effe-8e1d-4670-987c-9b49b5f605b2,0x800,0x1ff801)/File(\EFI\systemd\systemd-bootx64.efi)
Boot0001* gentoo	HD(1,GPT,02f231b8-8f9a-471c-b3a9-dc7edb1bd70e,0x800,0xee000)/File(\EFI\gentoo\grubx64.efi)
Boot0003* Gentoo Linux	PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1f,0x2)/Sata(2,32768,0)/HD(1,GPT,73f682fe-e07b-4870-be82-d85077f8aaa2,0x800,0x100000)/File(\EFI\systemd\systemd-bootx64.efi)
```

I'm only Gentoo in my system so I don't really need anything but the Gentoo entry so I just delete everything with:

```shell
efibootmgr -b <entry_id> -B
```

Once everything is delete we can add our new systemd-boot loader entry:

```shell
efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sda -p 2 -L "Gentoo" -l "\efi\boot\bootx64.efi"
```

Perfect, we're almost ready to reboot.

## Rebooting into our new Gentoo systemd

### Enable lvm2

```shell
systemctl enable lvm2-lvmetad.service
```

### Change the root password

While in chroot we need to change the root password of our new system just before rebooting it.

```shell
passwd
```

### And reboot to your new Gentoo system

Don't worry you don't need to cross your fingers, everything should goes fine :smirk:

```shell
exit # To exit from chroot
sync # To sync filesystems
reboot
```

## Post-installation

### Setting the Hostname

When booted using systemd, a tool called hostnamectl exists for editing /etc/hostname and /etc/machine-info. So we don't need to edit the file manually simlpy run:

```shell
hostnamectl set-hostname <hostname>
```

### Configuring Network

Let's plug our new Gentoo system to the world!! :earth_africa:

We can choose between two options, to use systemd as network manager or standalone one, I prefer networkmanager but here are the two options:

### Using systemd-networkd

systemd-networkd is useful for simple configuration of wired network interfaces. As it's disabled by default we need to configure it by creating a \*.network file under /etc/systemd/network.

Here is an example for a simple ethernet DHCP configuration:

```shell
nano -w /etc/systemd/network/50-dhcp.network
```

```shell
[Match]
Name=en*
[Network]
DHCP=yes
```

And then tell systemd to manage and start that service:

```shell
systemctl enable systemd-networkd.service
systemctl start systemd-networkd.service
```

### Using NetworkManager

Often NetworkManager is used to configure network settings. I personally use nmtui because it's easy and has a ncurses client. Just install it:

```shell
emerge -a networkmanager
```

And now simply run the following command and follow a guided configuration process through nmtui:

```shell
nmtui
```

### Setting locales

Yes, you're right, we set the locales before but once booted with systemd, the tool localectl is used to set locale and console or X11 keymaps. So, let's set it again to be sure that everything goes fine.

To change the system locale, run the following command:

```shell
localectl set-locale LANG=en_US.utf8
```

Change the virtual console keymap:

```shell
localectl set-keymap es
```

And finally, to set the X11 layout:

```shell
localectl set-x11-keymap es
```

### Setting time and date

Time and date can be set using the timedatectl utility. That will also allow users to set up synchronization without needing to rely on net-misc/ntp or other providers than systemd's own implementation.

To set the local time of the system clock directly:

```shell
timedatectl set-time "yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss"
```

To set time zone:

```shell
timedatectl list-timezones
timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Madrid
```

Set systemd-timesyncd as a simple SNTP daemon. Systemd-timesyncd that only implements a client side, focusing only on querying time from one remote server. It should be more than appropriate for most installations.

```shell
timedatectl set-ntp true
```

To check the status of the daemon:

```shell
timedatectl status
```

When starting, systemd-timesyncd will read the configuration file from /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf. To add time servers or change the provided ones, uncomment the relevant line and list their host name or IP separated by a space. I'm using [the NTP pool project](http://www.pool.ntp.org) for the main servers and the default Gentoo as fallback:

```shell
nano -w /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf
```

```shell
[Time]
NTP=0.europe.pool.ntp.org 1.europe.pool.ntp.org 2.europe.pool.ntp.org 3.europe.pool.ntp.org
FallbackNTP=0.gentoo.pool.ntp.org 1.gentoo.pool.ntp.org 2.gentoo.pool.ntp.org 3.gentoo.pool.ntp.org
```

### File indexing

In order to index the file system to provide faster file location capabilities we will install sys-apps/mlocate:

```shell
emerge -a sys-apps/mlocate
```

To keep databse update we need to run `updatedb` often.

### Filesystem tools

Additional to the tools for managing ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystems (sys-fs/e2fsprogs) which are already installed as a part of the *@system* set I like to install other filesystem utilities like VFAT, XFS, NTFS and so on:

```shell
emerge -a sys-fs/xfsprogs sys-fs/exfat-utils sys-fs/dosfstools sys-fs/ntfs3g
```

### Adding a user for daily use

Until now we have done everything as root but working as root on a Unix/Linux system is dangerous and should be avoided as much as possible. Therefore it is strongly recommended to add a user for day-to-day use.

The groups the user is member of define what activities the user can perform. The following table lists a number of important groups:

|  Group  |                                 Description                                 |
| :-----: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  audio  |                    Be able to access the audio devices.                     |
|  games  |                           Be able to play games.                            |
| portage |               Be able to access portage restricted resources.               |
|   usb   |                       Be able to access USB devices.                        |
|  video  | Be able to access video capturing hardware and doing hardware acceleration. |
|  wheel  |                             Be able to use su.                              |

Once you selected which groups would you like to add simply run:

```shell
useradd -m -G users,wheel,audio,video,audio,usb -s /bin/bash <username>
```

To set the user password run:

```shell
passwd <username>
```

### Exec as root with sudo

Sudo is a way that a regular user could run commands as root user. It's very useful to avoid using root password each time we need to run a command which needs root perms. To install run:

```shell
emerge -a app-admin/sudo
```

Then edit config file with command:

```shell
visudo
```

There's lot of examples inside the config file so we should not have any problem to set it up.

### Removing installation tarballs

With the Gentoo installation finished and the system rebooted, if everything has gone well, we can now remove the downloaded stage3 tarball from the hard disk. Remember that they were downloaded to the / directory.

```shell
rm /stage3-*.tar.bz2*
```

### Power consumption optimization with Powertop

```shell
emerge -a sys-power/powertop
```

The first step we need to do is to calibrate it, it's quite long process but the most important is to keep our system until the whole process is finished.

```shell
powertop --calibrate
```

To apply automatically optimal settings at boot we need to create a new Systemd unit:

```shell
nano -w /etc/systemd/system/powertop.service
```

```shell
[Unit]
Description=Powertop tunings

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/powertop --auto-tune

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable at each boot:

```shell
systemctl enable powertop.service
```

### GPU

Prior to install xorg we will configure our video card, mine is Intel Generation 6 so we need to add this line into make.conf:

```shell
nano -w /etc/portage/make.conf
```

```shell
VIDEO_CARDS="intel i965"
```

Before installing xorg we need to configure it again by adding custom graphic card information:

```shell
nano -w /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf
```

```shell
Section "Device"
   Identifier  "Intel Graphics"
   Driver      "intel"
	Option      "AccelMethod"  "sna"
	Option      "DRI"          "3"
	Option      "Backlight"    "intel_backlight"
EndSection
```

### Input devices

We need to do the same with the input devices. I'm using a laptop so check if you need to add joystick, mouse, keyboard, ... :wink:

```shell
nano -w /etc/portage/make.conf
```

```shell
INPUT_DEVICES="evdev synaptics
```

### X server

At the time to write this guide wayland is available but I'ld like to use bspwm which only support xorg so I'll continue with xorg server installation and configuration:

```shell
emerge -a xorg-server
```

### A bunch of useful stuff

```shell
emerge -a app-admin/ccze app-arch/unp app-editors/vim app-eselect/eselect-awk app-misc/screen app-shells/gentoo-zsh-completions app-shells/gentoo-zsh-completions app-vim/colorschemes app-vim/eselect-syntax app-vim/genutils app-vim/ntp-syntax media-gfx/feh sys-process/htop x11-terms/rxvt-unicode
```

### Portage nice value

We're running portage with modified scheduling priority, to not impact whole system performance during compilation.

```shell
echo 'PORTAGE_NICENESS="15"' >> /etc/portage/make.conf
```

### Setting portage branches

Branch defines if portage use stable or testing packages. Every package in the portage tree has it stable and testing version. The ACCEPT_KEYWORDS variable defines what software branch to use on the system. It defaults to the stable software branch for the system's architecture, for instance amd64.

I recommend to stick with the stable branch. However, if stability is not that much important for you and/or want to help out Gentoo by submitting bug reports to [https://bugs.gentoo.org](https://bugs.gentoo.org), then the testing is your way.

There are two ways to approach the testing branch for packages:

1. System wide setting: to make or system set to testing branch.

>```shell
>nano -w /etc/portage/make.conf
>```
>```shell
>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~amd64"
>```

2. Per package setting: we can set testing branch only for particular packages (This is and example, set whatever you want).

>```shell
>nano -w /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
>```
>```shell
>sys-kernel/gentoo-sources
>sys-power/powertop
>app-admin/pass
>```

### Masked and unmasked packages

Masking a package the way where Gentoo Developers block a package version from being auto installed. The reason why that package is masked is mentioned in the package.mask file (situated in /usr/portage/profiles/ by default). But if we still wants to use this package, then add the desired version (usually this will be the exact same line from the package.mask file in the profile) to the /etc/portage/package.unmask file (or in a file in that directory if it is a directory).

```shell
nano -w /etc/portage/package.unmask
```

```shell
>=app-emulation/docker-compose-1.5.2
>=app-emulation/docker-swarm-1.1.3
>=app-emulation/docker-1.7.1
```

It is also possible to ask Portage not to take a certain package or a specific version of a package into account. To do so, mask the package by adding an appropriate line to the /etc/portage/package.mask location (either in that file or in a file in this directory).

```shell
nano -w /etc/portage/package.mask
```

```shell
=sys-kernel/gentoo-sources-4.5.0
```

### Overlays

Overlays contain additional packages for your Gentoo system while the main repository contains all the software packages maintained by Gentoo developers, additional package trees are usually hosted by repositories. Users can add such additional repositories to the tree that are "laid over" the main tree - hence the name, overlays.

```shell
emerge -a app-portage/layman
```

To list all available overlays simply run:

```shell
layman -L
```

To install an overlay run:

```shell
layman -a <overlay_name>
```

To keep your installed overlays up to date, run:

```shell
layman -S
```

#### Custom overlay

If we want to maintain a custom set of ebuilds we just only need to create a local overlay doing these few steps:

```shell
mkdir -p /usr/local/portage/{metadata,profiles}
echo '<overlay_name>' > /usr/local/portage/profiles/repo_name
echo 'masters = gentoo' > /usr/local/portage/metadata/layout.conf
chown -R portage:portage /usr/local/portage
```

Next, tell portage about the overlay:

```shell
mkdir -p /etc/portage/repos.conf
```

```shell
nano -w /etc/portage/repos.conf/local.conf
```

```shell
[<overlay_name>]
location = /usr/local/portage
auto-sync = no
```

### Virtualization (How to use Qemu & kvm)
Virtualization is widely use nowadays. Everybody wants to test some environments, apps, or simply have a virtualized machine with other operating systems. In order to do that we should use any virtualization platform available for desktop use such as virtualbox, kvm/qemu, xen or vmware. Among all these options I choose kvm/qemu because its performance and simplicity. So here we are!

First we need to check if our hardware support virtualization:

```shell
grep --color -E "vmx|svm" /proc/cpuinfo
```

We could also check if kvm device is available in our */dev* directory:

```shell
ls /dev/kvm
```

If both are available we can continue installing kvm, otherwise you shouldn't use virtualization on your machine.

#### Kernel options

Before continue building kvm with should check if we have some kernel options enabled as module or build-in.

```shell
[*] Virtualization  --->
    <*>   Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) support
    <*>   KVM for Intel processors support <-- if we use Intel cpu, otherwise disable it
    <*>   KVM for AMD processors support <-- if we use AMD cpu, otherwise disable it
    <*>   Host kernel accelerator for virtio net
Device Drivers  --->
   [*] Network device support  --->
      [*]   Network core driver support
      <*>   Universal TUN/TAP device driver support
   [*] Networking support  --->
      Networking options  --->
         <*> The IPv6 protocol
         <*> 802.1d Ethernet Bridging
   File systems  --->
      <*> The Extended 4 (ext4) filesystem
      [*]   Ext4 Security Labels
```

Once we have kernel compiled and running with new options we can continue by installing package:

```shell
emerge -av app-emulation/qemu
```

In order to run kvm as normal user and not as root we should add our user account to the *kvm* group:

```shell
gpasswd -a <username> kvm
```

Finally, to be sure that libvirt daemon is running all the time we should enable with systemd:

```shell
systemctl enable libvirtd.service
```

### Speed up the system with prelink

What is Prelink and how can it help me? I'm sure that most of you are asking this question right now well, most applications we have installed in our system use shared libraries. Every time a program call this libraries they need to be loaded into memory. As more libraries program needs as more time it takes to resolve all symbol references. So prelink simply "maps" this symbol references and makes applications run faster. Of course this is a summary of what it does, but it's enough for us.

The only thing we need to do is to prelink binaries every time we upgrade or install any new program o library. But don't worry, portage will automatically prelink our system for us each time we install a package if we have prelink installed in our system. That's great!!

So we will simply install prelink:

```shell
emerge -av prelink
```

Then configure the package by running env-update and then editing config file:

```shell
env-update
```

Unfortunately we can't prelink files that were compiled by old versions of binutils. Be default prelink define a number of libraries and directories which as blacklisted to avoid prelinking them. We can add or remove directories in prelink config files:

```shell
nano /etc/prelink.conf
nano /etc/prelink.conf.d/*
```

Finally we will prelink our system with:

```shell
prelink -amR
```

Which is:

- **a**: prelink all binary files.
- **m**: conserve virtual memory space. If we have a lot of binaries to prelink it takes a lot of space during the process, this parameter will ensure that we not run out of memory.
- **R**: randomize the address ordering to enhance security against buffer overflows.
